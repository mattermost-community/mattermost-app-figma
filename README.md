# Figma App

A Figma app for Mattermost.

### Notes

1. Currently not working due to Figma API problems with webhooks. FILE_COMMENT webhook is not working. Ticket for Figma team is created. Investigation is in progress;
2. Due to API call limit notify file owner logic and preselect team id during subscribe logic should be removed; 

### First steps 

#### Setting up 
1. Run Mattermost server https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/README.md
2. Install/Enable Apps plugin  https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps
3. Register a figma app - https://www.figma.com/developers/api#register-oauth2
   * as a callback url use - http://MM_INSTANCE__ROOT_URL/plugins/com.mattermost.apps/apps/figma/oauth2/remote/complete
   * Copy the client secret for a future step
4. Run Figma integration server app
   * Run `docker-compose up` in the root of the Figma App repository
5. In mattermost channel run `/apps install http http://localhost:8080/manifest.json`

#### Link MM account with Figma

1. Run command `/figma configure` and provide client id and client secret from register a figma app step https://www.figma.com/developers/apps
2. Run command `/figma connect` and open link from bot response for linking mm with figma account 

### Usage
